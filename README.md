# Maceo - Analyze and anonymize data in real-time

Maceo is an [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/) serverless function designed
to **analyze** and **anonymize** personally identifiable information (PII) in
real-time. It leverages the powerful capabilities of
[Microsoft Presidio](https://github.com/microsoft/presidio) to detect and
redact sensitive data such as names, phone numbers, emails, and more.

## Features

- üß† **PII Detection** ‚Äì Uses Presidio Analyzer to identify PII in text
- üõ°Ô∏è **Anonymization** ‚Äì Applies Presidio Anonymizer to redact detected PII
- ‚ö° **Real-Time Functionality** ‚Äì Runs as an OpenFaaS function for scalable, on-demand usage
- üîß **Configurable** ‚Äì Customize what types of PII to detect

## Use Cases

- Data privacy compliance (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)
- Real-time chat or support log redaction
- Secure logging or auditing pipelines
- Anonymizing customer feedback or user-generated content

## Architecture

Maceo serves as a wrapper function that accepts a plain text, sends the input
to Presidio for analysis and anonymization and returns the redacted version of
the original text.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [OpenFaaS](https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/) installed and running
- [Microsoft Presidio - For PII anonymization in text](https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/installation/#using-docker) installed and running

### Deploying with OpenFaaS

```bash
export OPENFAAS_URL=https://openfaas.example.com
faas-cli secret create --from-literal='{}' maceo
faas-cli deploy --image=ghcr.io/tschaefer/maceo:0.1.0 --name=maceo
```
This creates the required empty configuration secret for the function and
deploys the function to your OpenFaaS instance.

See [Blog Post](https://blog.tschaefer.org) for a detailed guide on how to set
up with [OpenFaaS Edge](https://docs.openfaas.com/deployment/edge/).

## Usage

Send a POST request to the function with a plain text payload.

```bash
curl --include --request POST https://maceo.example.com \
  --header "Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8" \
  --data-binary  "@contrib/sample"
HTTP/2 200

## Configuration

The function can be configured using a secret. The secret is a JSON object
containing the following keys:

- `upstreams`: The URLs of the Presidio Analyzer and Anonymizer services.
    - `analyze`: The URL for the Presidio Analyzer service. (default: `http://10.62.0.1:5001`)
    - `anonymize`: The URL for the Presidio Anonymizer service. (default: `http://10.62.0.1:5002`)
- `entities`: The list of PII entities to detect and anonymize. (default: `nil`)
- `language`: The language to use for PII detection. (default: `en`)
- `score_threshold`: The minimum score for a PII entity to be considered detected. (default: `0.0`)

Find an example configuration in the `contrib/config` file.

## Health Check

The function exposes a health check endpoint at `/health`. The check verifies
the syntax of the configuration secret and the availability of the Presidio
services. It returns a 200 OK status if everything is working correctly and a
500 status if there are any issues.

```bash
curl --include --request GET https://maceo.example.com/health
